# Spot-Based Global Registration (SBGR)

## Overview

SBGR is a novel strategy for achieving precise image stitching at the single-molecule level in tissue-scale **spatial transcriptomics**. This method shifts the focus from raw images to identified molecular spots, enabling high-resolution image alignment with exceptional accuracy.

## Features

- **Spot-Based Data:** SBGR utilizes identified molecular spots for image alignment, offering a robust evaluation of translation estimates and stitching performance.
  
- **Sub-pixel Accuracy:** Achieves sub-pixel accuracy (83 Â± 36 nm) outperforming existing image-based stitching methods.
  
- **Duplicate Spot Removal:** Incorporates a mechanism to surgically remove duplicate spots in overlapping regions, maximizing information recovery.


# Usage examples
Put SBGR.py on your repository.
$ stitched_spots,stitched_positions = SBGR(pix_size, save_folder, spot_loc, position_loc, edge_pix, z_step):
